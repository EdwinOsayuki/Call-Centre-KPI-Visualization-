# Call-Centre-KPI-Visualization-

KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are quantifiable measurements used to gauge a company's overall long-term performance. This helps to weigh and determine a company's strategic, financial, and operational achievements. They are used to measure a company's success in relations to its set goals and targets. High-level KPIs may focus on the general overview of the performance of the business, while low-level KPIs may focus on processes in departments such as tech, sales, marketing, HR, support and others. KPIs are more than just numbers in weekly reports - they enable the key business players understand the performance and overall growth of their business so that they can make critical adjustments in the execution of their strategic goals. Knowing and measuring the right KPIs will help achieve results faster.

**KPIs are mainly used to **

1. Measure progress
2. Monitor company growth
3. Keep players in check
4. Analyze patterns overtime
5. Make adjustments where neccessary.

The various types of KPIs include Qualitative and Quantitative Indicators, Actionable Indicators, Financial Indicators, Process Indicators, Directional and Practical Indicators and so much more.

For this KPI Visualization, I used the PwC Forage Internship Call Centre Dataset. The task was to give the manager an accurate overview of long term trends in customer and agent behaviour. The dataset contains a record of 5000 calls made in the call centre. The possible KPIs required were

1. Overall customer satisfaction
2. Overall calls answered/abandoned
3. Average speed of answer
4. Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
